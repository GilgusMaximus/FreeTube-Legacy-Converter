About two years ago, we went out on the street and asked people, if they could name a country on the map. Many of them could not. This had nothing to do with their political affiliation, but Ted Cruz posted it and wrote… “This is Bernie’s base - the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.” Unfortunately, the guy talking about facts, truth and substance, made that all up. These were not Bernie supporters - we don’t know who they supported, we didn’t ask. Bernie wasn’t even running when we shot that. So, we decided to revisit this by asking people who do not support Bernie Sanders (in fact, quite the opposite) to name a country, and this is how that went.\n\nTrump Says Coronavirus is Very Much Under Control https://youtu.be/PbrX_uadZPA\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n \nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10\n \nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n \nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFB\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTW\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n \nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n \nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" ABC's late-night talk show.\n\n\"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.\nSome of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like \"I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum\" and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.\nNow in its seventeenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.\n\nCan You Name a Country?\nhttps://youtu.be/umpalMtQE50","viewCount":229541,"title":"Can You Name a Country?","lengthSeconds":205,"videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/umpalMtQE50/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1582820707721,"watchProgress":0,"_id":"1p6gWbYSGJCoD9j2"}

Schön zuhause rumliegen und YouTube Videos gucken, auf einem Computer der viel leistungsfähiger ist als alles was die Menschheit noch bis vor kurzem bauen konnte. Diesen Fortschritt und die ganzen tollen Geräte, die du für selbstverständlich hältst, gäbe es nicht ohne seltene und wertvolle Rohstoffe wie Terbium, Neodym oder Tantal.\nDer Weg auf dem diese Elemente aus der Erde in dein Smartphone kommen ist häßlich. Bergbau ist verantwortlich für Luft und Wasserverschmutzung und zerstört ganze Landstriche. Gefährliche Chemikalien wie Cyanide, Schwefelsäure und Chlor werden genutzt um die Bodenschätze zu extrahieren, bedrohen dabei die Biodiversität und schädigen Arbeiter und Anwohner. Bodenschätze sind auch politische Werkzeuge: Wenn Länder den Zugriff auf sie verweigern, können sie dadurch Macht ausüben.\nWäre es nicht schön, wenn wir den Bergbau auf der Erde durch einen sauberen Prozess ersetzen könnten der niemandem schadet? Naja, das können wir.

Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible.\n\nPlace decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in.\n\n\nCure unusual illnesses\n\nDon’t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine.\n\nDiagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. You can handle a single patient – but can you handle a Pandemic?\n\nOnce you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut.\n\n\nImprove and expand your hospital horizons!\n\nYour first hospital is where it begins, but what next?\n\nOnce you’ve cured the residents of a small harbour village, can you take on a bigger challenge in a busier hospital?\n\nImprove your facilities, upgrade machines, staff and layouts to make more money, more quickly.\n\nTrain and improve your staff, levelling them up with new skills and abilities to make your hospital even more efficient.\n\nMake use of the extensive statistic and information screens to analyse your strengths and weaknesses, and make rapid alterations. Adjust the price of your treatments, keep an eye on your turnover, take out loans and optimise your earnings.\n\nYou’ll be managing staff with unique personality types and traits, so you’ll need to keep an eye on who’s being efficient – and who is just a pain in the neck. Balance your workforce with your ambitions as you strive to make profit (and hopefully save some people along the way).","viewCount":"139413","title":"Two Point Hospital: LAUNCH TRAILER (Full 60 second cut)","lengthSeconds":"60","videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/SjrcU1gwkjc/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1578159310574,"watchProgress":51.61618,"_id":"49b7vV1kfs8nS34H"}

And how do you follow-up a single that's hit No.1 in 8 countries? If you're Sigma, you go straight into the studio, call up Paloma Faith and a full orchestra, and produce a monster hit-in-waiting in 'Changing'. \n\nPremiered on Radio 1 courtesy of Annie Mac (Special Delivery, 11/7/14), 'Changing' shows Sigma aka Cameron Edwards and Joe Lenzie in sparkling form, making good use of studio time in between a packed summer schedule with shows across the UK, Europe, North America and Australia, including Glastonbury, Global Gathering, Ibiza Rocks and Bestival.\n\nSigma's remixes for Kiesza ('Hideaway'), Route 94 ('My Love'), Clean Bandit ('Extraordinary'), DJ Fresh ('Dibby Dibby Sound') and DJ Zinc ('Show Me') have helped make 2014 their best year to date, further proof that the UK duo have big intentions ahead of the artist album they're currently putting the finishing touches to.\n\nLeeds University alumni -- alongside Rusko -- Sigma met while balancing raving and studying, working in record shops and promoting events to top up their student loans. While some don their artist mantle when the occasion demands it, Cameron and Joe have made Sigma their 'life' since graduation. Early releases with Hospital Records, Viper, Bingo and DJ Fresh's Breakbeat Kaos, as well as their own Life Recordings, quickly marked them out as producers to watch, while remixes for Eric Prydz, Ellie Goulding, Stylo G and Sway began to take them to a wider audience. The world, it seems, is now their oyster.\n\nThree-time BRIT nominee Paloma Faith released her third album 'A Perfect Contradiction' on March 10, the follow-up to 2012's double platinum selling 'Fall To Grace', and her debut 'Do You Want The Truth Or Something Beautiful?' (also double platinum). Her new album features a roster of legendary music icons, singer-songwriters and producers including Pharrell Williams (who collaborated on first single 'Can't Rely On You'), Diane Warren, Plan B, John Legend, Stewart Matthewman and Raphael Saadiq. 'A Perfect Contradiction' has not left the Top 10 since it was released, and has already achieved gold status.","viewCount":52879284,"title":"Sigma ft Paloma Faith - Changing (Official Video)","lengthSeconds":208,"videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/oAeotgCHL3E/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1570221833241,"watchProgress":7.694991,"_id":"4gzVZRRxj6kUs4AA"}

While trying to find her way in life, she discovered her passion for spoken word poetry. She shares her journey of leaving behind the safe and stable path and taking the daring step to pursue her dreams and passion. Take a look, it’s very poetic! Taz Alam graduated with a law degree from Cardiff University in 2015. After graduating she went through a period of feeling lost and it was during this difficult time that she discovered her love for spoken word poetry. She was particularly drawn to how spoken word is an impactful way of expressing powerful messages, and how it gave her a voice at a time where she felt the most helpless. Taz started posting videos online talking about difficult topics ranging from mental health, social issues, and body image, transforming them into empowering poems. She gradually grew her audience and now uses her platform to give a voice to vulnerable people. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Greta discusses her struggles with depression at an early age, which caused her to stop eating and talking. \"When you are the only one who reacts about this crisis and everyone else seems to just [say], ‘Okay, it's very important but I am too busy with my life… I just thought that it was very strange that no one else was behaving in a logical way,\" Greta says. \"Nothing seemed to matter anymore. But then I started to come back, to become better, to feel better. And a reason for that was because I saw that there are actually things you can do.\" She talks about her refusal to travel via plane, commitment to a vegan lifestyle and decision to acquire most of her clothes secondhand. Now a central figure in the global climate movement, Greta will address the U.N. Climate Action Summit on September 23 in New York. \n\n#DemocracyNow\n\nDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

In diesem Video und im folgenden Text findet Ihr Hintergründe dazu. Gibt es wirklich kein Experiment, das die Wirkung von CO2 als Treibhausgas bestätigt?

These are things that might feel obvious at first, but which will become more and more necessary the further you get into your studies. Full agenda listed below 👇\n\nThe life of a university student can sometimes feel completely overwhelming with the huge amount of deliverables and exams that are due at all times. In addition to to studying 9 months straight, most university students also opt to apply for summer jobs that last for 3-4 months. All of this means that students rarely get a break and a chance to go on a holiday. This is why it is so important to understand how to balance ones studies with ones free time in order not to burn out.\n\nWhile most YouTube videos focus on time keeping and organising ones work, this video is going to focus on things that you can do IN ADDITION to your studies that will help you get your mind out of school and thus, avoid you to overwhelm yourself with work.\n\nHOW TO BALANCE YOUR STUDIES WITH YOUR FREE TIME\n0:00 Intro\n1:02 Volunteer in a student organisation or club\n2:02 Travel as much as possible\n3:23 Keep care of your body with sports\n4:55 Start a new hobby\n6:23 Schedule time for your friends\n6:40 Learn to give yourself some slack\n8:35 Stop chasing a perfect GPA\n\nThanks for Aalto University for sponsoring this video.

What to do when we're about to give in to temptation? How can we achieve what we set out to do without feeling like we have to convince ourselves to get to work?

His current research, focuses on what motivates us as humans, and why we sometimes struggle with conflicting drives and a lack of willpower.

Sigma have now sold 1.75 million singles worldwide in just 10 months, gone Platinum in the UK (‘NTL’) and Gold for ‘Changing’ in Germany, and Benelux, and Platinum in Australia and New Zealand (‘NTL’). They’ve hit 432,844 worldwide radio plays and reached a radio audience of 1 billion, and held the UK TV Airplay Chart No.1 spot for 11 weeks combined. ‘Nobody To Love’ recently became the first drum & bass track to hit 100 million YouTube views, with the tally for both singles fast approaching 120 million.\n\n2015 festival bookings include Snowbombing, Future Music Festival and Electric Daisy Carnival. These follow 2014 shows across the UK, Europe, USA and Australia, including two sold out dates at Ministry of Sound, Glastonbury, Global Gathering, Ibiza Rocks and Bestival. \n\nWith stunning vocals from Labrinth, ‘Higher’ also sees Sigma once again collaborating with UK songwriting giants TMS and Wayne Hector (with whom they made ‘Changing’).\n\nOutside of their own releases, Sigma have shored up their reputation as an in demand remix duo, with 2014 mixes for the likes of Kiesza (‘Hideaway’), Route 94 (‘My Love’), Clean Bandit (‘Extraordinary’), DJ Fresh (‘Dibby Dibby Sound’) and DJ Zinc (‘Show Me’).\n\nLeeds University alumni – alongside Rusko – Sigma met while balancing raving and studying, working in record shops and promoting events to top up their student loans. Early releases with Hospital Records, Viper, Bingo and DJ Fresh’s Breakbeat Kaos, as well as their own Life Recordings, quickly marked them out as producers to watch, while remixes for Eric Prydz, Ellie Goulding, Stylo G and Sway began to take them to a wider audience.\n\nDirector De La Muerte \nProducer Cal Gordon\nProduction Manager Marcel Dambon\nProduction Manager Michi Baumgartner\nDOP Luke Jacobs\nFocus Puller Tom McMahon\nProduction Company Burning Reel","viewCount":7130686,"title":"Sigma ft.

{"videoId":"2DPp2NcnTb0","published":1517443200,"publishedText":"Feb 2nd, 2018","description":"Wooden skyscrapers are an ambitious and innovative solution to the problems posed by urbanisation. Not only are they faster to build, they have smaller carbon footprints than high-rises made of concrete and steel.  \n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2GCblkl \n\nBy 2050 the world’s population is expected to soar to almost 10 billion people and two-thirds of us will live in cities. \n\nSpace will be at a premium.\n\nHigh-rise offers a solution. But concrete and steel – the materials we currently use to build high – have a large carbon footprint. \n\nAn answer might lie in a natural material we’ve used for millennia.\n\nThroughout history buildings have been made of wood. \n\nBut it has one major drawback. It acts as kindling. \n\nFire destroyed large swathes of some of the world’s great cities.\n\nBut by the early twentieth century, the era of modern steelmaking had arrived. \n\nSteel was strong, could be moulded into any shape and used to reinforce concrete. It allowed architects to build higher than ever before.\n\nSo why, after more than a century of concrete and steel, are some architects proposing a return to wood?\n\nConcrete and steel are costly to produce and heavy to transport. \n\nWood however can be grown sustainably and it’s lighter than concrete.\n\nAnd crucially, as trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the air, locking it into the timber.\n\nOne study showed that using wood to construct a 125-metre skyscraper could reduce a building’s carbon footprint by up to 75%\n\nRegular timber isn’t malleable like steel or concrete, and isn’t strong enough to build high.  \n\nBut engineers have come up with a solution. It’s called cross-laminated timber, or CLT for short.\n \n\nCLT is light and it’s comparable in strength to concrete and steel.  \n\nBut how does it cope when burnt with a high heat source? \n\nLondon architects Waugh Thistleton are already designing buildings with this new kind of timber. \n\nAndrew and his colleagues designed Britain’s first high-rise wooden apartment block and have recently completed the world’s largest timber-based building.\n\nBehind these bricks is a timber core, made from more than 2000 trees, sourced from sustainable forests.\n\nAnd this London practice is not alone in advocating the use of CLT.\n\nAmbitious wooden high-rise buildings are also being constructed in Scandinavia, central Europe and North America.\n\nAs yet, nobody has used CLT to build beyond 55 metres. \n\nBut Michael Ramage’s research centre in Cambridge, working with another London practice, has proposed a concept design of a 300-metre tower, that could be built on top of one of London’s most iconic concrete structures – the Barbican.\n\nMaking that jump in height will be a difficult sell.\n\nThe cost of building wooden skyscrapers is largely unknown, but those costs could be reduced by prefabricating large sections of buildings in factories.\n \nAnd city-dwellers will need to be persuaded that CLT does not burn like ordinary wood. \n\nAs an attractive, natural material, wood is already popular for use in low buildings. \n\nIf planners approve, it could rise to new heights.\n\nDaily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.\n\nFor more from Economist Films visit: http://econ.st/2GCbm7T \nCheck out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk \nLike The Economist on Facebook: http://econ.st/2GCbnIZ \nFollow The Economist on Twitter: http://econ.st/2GAXgUa \nFollow us on Instagram: http://econ.st/2GAXhrc \nFollow us on LINE: http://econ.st/1WXkOo6 \nFollow us on Medium: http://econ.st/2GAXivg","viewCount":812531,"title":"Wooden skyscrapers could be the future for cities | The Economist","lengthSeconds":386,"videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/2DPp2NcnTb0/maxres.jpg","author":"The Economist","authorId":"UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1570738012571,"watchProgress":372.743688,"_id":"H7QFH82HtX8JP79T"}

As most of you are aware, there are a lot of different scammers out there and these include Nigerian prince email scammers, Indian tech support scammers, IRS scammers and others. They have been around for over 10 years now and they don’t seem to be going anywhere. After getting a lot of calls, sometimes very early in the morning I have decided enough is enough. If the government won’t shut down these pests then I will. \n\nI created some virtual machines and started calling scammers using a fake caller ID. The calls were quite hilarious so I started uploading them on YouTube; this was great as I was raising awareness about scams while also earning money. In total I have called scammers over ten thousand times in the past year and a half. I created a number of programs to annoy them including a call flooder that can call the scammers many times per minute which overloads their phones.\n\nGET SCAMMER NUMBERS: https://www.scammer.info/\n\nSUPPORT MALCOLM MERLYN: \n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/malcolmmerlyn\nDONATE: https://streamlabs.com/malcolmmerlyng...\nMERCHANDISE: https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/M...\nBITCOIN: bc1qazm7lf0vefcygfxlmcsdknkun36q5zdczev5y0\nMONERO: 48uXksDGWfBJSMPdwHbPJMexZSeWKTnzdB7g2NV4obKpGR53mU365ZSDeyPiiEyptDLNKmSTLYh58GWB1ssFUFTJ2kGq8Ds\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: \n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/MerlynYouTube/\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MerlynGlobal/\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/malcolmmerl...\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THESE CHANNELS:\n\nDeeveeaar: https://www.youtube.com/c/deeveeaar/\nMalcolm Merlyn: https://www.youtube.com/c/malcolmmerl...\nKaiba Corporation: https://www.youtube.com/user/YGOProKC\n\nDOWNLOADS:\n\nAnti-Scammer Toolset: http://www.mediafire.com/file/ilpe5ka...\nYu-Gi-Oh!

After a spectacular demonstration of number memorization, he explains why we can remember things better if we put them into context, and teaches us how to go beyond the current abilities of our memory. With personal stories, he shows how this technique can help you at school, in your career, or even if you just want to make a point in a discussion.\n\nSimon Reihnard was born in Munich and studied Law there, finishing in the top 7.5% of his class. During his university career, he came into contact with memory techniques; he learned that there was such a thing as „memory sports“, the competitive memorizing of different kinds of information (numbers, names, words, cards) in a set tournament format. He started competing right away and found it thoroughly fascinating to memorize more and more information with the help of techniques which use a set of locations and images.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

I am the writer, director and filmmaker of \"Life in the Arctic Circle - Northern Norway\"\n\nI’m a 29 year old movie director, photographer and storyteller. I’m extremely passionate about sharing positive messages through emotional content. I’ve been fortunate to travel the world and experience it’s diversity. Meeting different cultures, people and experiencing the richness of wildlife, nature and untouched places.\n\nLIFE IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE\nThis movie is something that I’ve wanted to do for a long time. The North and everything up there fascinates me. Especially during the winter season. Huge untouched landscapes, rough weather that constantly changes, rich wildlife and people who live through this daily.\n\nIn February 2019 I went with my girlfriend to northern Norway to spend a few days there. I couldn't resist the urge to film everything I saw. There was so much beauty up in the Arctic.\n\nWhen I got home, I saw the potential of my footage and knew there was more that I could do with it. However, I was missing key elements that could turn this into a story. A few months later, I returned to the same place to complete what I had already created. But this time with very concrete content and story ideas. For this trip I was accompanied by my good friend\nFlorian Fatton, who is a great photographer, and Michel Janssens (my dad), who like me loves the Nordic culture.\n\nCreating content up there is unique. Everything is beautiful (landscapes, lights etc ...) but it’s not easy. It’s dark almost all of the time in winter. We only had 2 hours of real light per day!\n\nThis movie is a short story about a man from the Sami tribe who’s lived up there for his entire life. It's also the first video of a series of others that I’m working on... ☺\n\nCREATORS\nAntoine Janssens | Director, Filmmaker, Editor & Sound design\nhttps://www.instagram.com/antoinejans/\nFlorian Fatton | Additional Filmmaker, Photographer\nhttps://www.instagram.com/flofatton/\n\nCAST\nAlfred Larsen | The Sami\nA big thank you to the people who helped me on this:\nMichel Janssens\nMégane Corbaz\nValhalla Orca Expedition http://valhallaorcaexpedition.com\nAlfred Larsen\nStephane Granzotto https://www.instagram.com/stephanegra...\nToast Prod\nand of course Beautiful Destinations\n\nMusic :\nYou will find your happiness on:\nhttp://share.mscbd.fm/antoinejans","viewCount":"17603","title":"Life in the Arctic Circle - Northern Norway","lengthSeconds":"176","videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/kl28cbwSq5U/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1580577650479,"watchProgress":0,"_id":"KYD1twLEyJfORw0Z"}

Talking a bit about the Youtube Algorithm, what i've done to try to exploit it, and also some other stuff, like my play button unboxing. \nIn the video I talk about a couple of important things, like CTR of \"Click through rate\". This is important, because without a high click through rate, people aren't gonna click on your videos, meaning you won't get any views. \nThe watch time is also curcial, and I talk a bit about how I try to keep the watch time as high as possible.\nSomething I didn't mention in the video, is that you have to find a recipe that works for you. For example \"progress\" videos and \"Making X in Y time\" works very well for me, but when people have tried to do the exact same thing, with the exact same thumbnail (just search for one of my popular videos, and you'll see a lot of copies), it hasn't worked out well for them. This is important to note, it shows that you have to find your own way, as different channels work in different ways. It's hard to explain, but after a while you will get the feel for what the algorithm wants from you lol. \n\nOne final note: Have fun. Don't make videos you don't wanna make, that's never gonna end well. If you make videos about stuff you enjoy, it's gonna be reflected in your content, and the viewers will be way more engaged. And the same goes for when you make content you don't enjoy: it's very noticable, and it's not gonna feel genuine.\n\n//about\nHey! If you're new here, welcome!

Lyrics below:\n\nIs this the real life?\nIs this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide\nNo escape from reality\nOpen your eyes\nLook up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go\nA little high, little low\nAnyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me\n\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head\nPulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooo\nDidn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters\n\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine\nBody's aching all the time\nGoodbye everybody - I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)\nI don't want to die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango\nThunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me\nGallileo, Gallileo,\nGallileo, Gallileo,\nGallileo Figaro - magnifico\n\nBut I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\nEasy come easy go - will you let me go\nBismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go - let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go - let me go\nWill not let you go - let me go (never)\nNever let you go - let me go\nNever let me go - ooo\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no -\nOh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\nfor me\nfor me\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die\nOh baby - can't do this to me baby\nJust gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here\n\nOoh yeah, ooh yeah\nNothing really matters\nAnyone can see\nNothing really matters - nothing really matters to me\n\nAnyway the wind blows...\n\nWelcome to the official Queen channel.

Night Shyamalan brings together the narratives of two of his standout originals—2000’s Unbreakable, from Touchstone, and 2016’s Split, from Universal—in one explosive, all-new comic-book thriller: Glass.  \n\nFrom Unbreakable, Bruce Willis returns as David Dunn as does Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah Price, known also by his pseudonym Mr. Glass.  Joining from Split are James McAvoy, reprising his role as Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities who reside within, and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, the only captive to survive an encounter with The Beast.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of Split, Glass finds Dunn pursuing Crumb’s superhuman figure of The Beast in a series of escalating encounters, while the shadowy presence of Price emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men.\n\nJoining the all-star cast are Unbreakable’s Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard, who reprise their roles as Dunn’s son and Price’s mother, as well as Golden Globe Award winner Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story series).\n \nThis riveting culmination of his worldwide blockbusters is produced by Shyamalan and Blumhouse Production’s Jason Blum, who also produced the writer/director’s previous two films for Universal.  They produce again with Ashwin Rajan and Marc Bienstock, and Steven Schneider and Kevin Frakes, who executive produce.  Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum also serve as executive producers.\n\nA Blinding Edge Pictures and Blumhouse production, Glass will be released by Universal Pictures in North America on January 18, 2019, and by Buena Vista International abroad.","viewCount":24224432,"title":"Glass - Official Trailer [HD]","lengthSeconds":173,"videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/95ghQs5AmNk/maxres.jpg","author":"Universal Pictures","authorId":"UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1566041716894,"watchProgress":170.80499,"_id":"L3Iz3oimLBX8yVq3"}

John David Washington’s character begins to walk towards it and on screen, we see the words. Time has come for a new protagonist.\n\nThe trailer reverses slightly to show some seconds of the prior shot and he once again steps forward the words, Time has come for a new mission then appear on the screen, and Washington gets close to the bullet and touches it which is when the music really ramps up. There’s a feeling of a ticking clock to it all and the film is reportedly going to be heavily time focused similar to Nolan’s prior films Inception, Memento, Interstellar and Dunkirk. This is also I’m guessing why Time appears so many times in the trailer and it looks like we may be getting some sort of clock bending movie set to the world of secret agents and spies.\n\nTenet Official teaser trailer explained full leaked first look\n\nWashington then walks along and we see three identical bullet holes all mirroring the first one and then we cut to Washington lying on his back, probably preparing for a mission and then a man in a gas mask running, then Washingtons character fighting a swat team member and then being dragged away which is when we cut to the title which spins into the screen.\n\nWe finish with Washington’s character wearing breathing apparatus and then his face lights up which ends the trailer.\n\nOk so not a huge indicator of what’s going on there but I have to say in full swing the trailer looks incredible and definitely gets my heart pounding due to the score. I will be doing a full breakdown when the official first look releases but I thought I’d just discuss the leak for the time being but yeah it looks great.\n\nYour Thoughts\nObviously I’d love to hear your thoughts on this first look as well as what you think the film will be about. Comment below and let me know and if you enjoyed this video then please like it and make sure you check out my full break down of the ending of Hobbs and Shaw which will be linked at the end. The trailer for Tenet showed before that film so it’s definitely worth checking out if you wanna know more.\n\nIf you wanna come talk to me about movies, tv shows, games and comic books then you can follow me on twitter at @deffinitionYT.

These brutal killings obscure a sinister truth, as Vera soon finds ties to a group of fanatics committed to creating an AI superintelligence — a pursuit outlawed for nearly a century.\n\nComplicating things, a great loss from Vera's past comes back to haunt her, making her question her own sanity and everything she stands for.\n\nAs an agent of the Central Bureau, Vera is equipped with an advanced nano-substance called Blue. This rare and sought-after technology allows her to develop superhuman abilities adapted to her psychological mindset.\n\nChoose your playstyle and utilize these augmentations to investigate, gather information, and solve puzzles with multiple solutions.\n\nWill Vera’s unique blend of skills and intuition be enough to solve the case, or will she discover that things are more ambiguous than they seemed?

Growing up, rationality often came before emotions for Ramona, but as she grew older and realized that she had never actively learned how to deal with her emotions and that she wasn’t the only one who lacked this skill, she knew she had to change something. In her talk, Ramona guides us through her experiences and shows us 6 steps to become more emotionally intelligent. Ramona Hacker has a degree in English and American Studies and is currently pursuing a Masters in World Heritage Studies. Through several personal experiences as well as her volunteer experience at a local soccer club and for the student organization AIESEC, she started thinking about the topic of emotional intelligence and how it affects everyone’s lives and the way we deal with our problems. She will share research from the field as well as personal stories with the TEDxTUM audience. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

That includes code, music, art, sound effect, no sleep, loads of coffee, oof.

Then I made a game in 12 hours, and finally last week, I did one in just 1 hour, called \"Making a Game in ONE HOUR\".

The Most Motivational Interview with Filmmaker Attila Korosi. This is how he went from a war torn country to a college athlete with a full scholarship and now a filmmaker in America.\n\n\"When I told people I want to go to America to make the greatest movies, they reacted as if I said I want to be an Astronaut and fly to Mars. Life is all about perspectives...Growing up in a war is not as bad as you might think. At least for a kid. People are kinder, closer, and everyone gives you candy. Schools are often closed and you get to play soccer, basketball, and hide and seek all day long. Now, don’t think I’m pro war or anything like that it is just as I said, life is about perspectives. War was given to me and I will make the best out of it. Regardless of your circumstances and the obstacles you might be facing, the human mind is built to do wonders. Everything else is just an excuse.

What are Volumes\n2. How to create / list / delete volumes\n3. How to attach volume to a container\n4. How to share volume among containers\n5. What are bind mounts\nVolumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers\n\n: docker volume  //get information\n: docker volume create\n: docker volume ls\n: docker volume inspect\n: docker volume rm\n: docker volume prune\n\nUse of Volumes\n===========\nDecoupling container from storage\nShare volume (storage/data) among different containers\nAttach volume to container\nOn deleting container volume does not delete\n\nCommands\ndocker run --name MyJenkins1 -v myvol1:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins\ndocker run --name MyJenkins2 -v myvol1:/var/jenkins_home -p 9090:8080 -p 60000:50000 jenkins\nocker run --name MyJenkins3 -v /Users/raghav/Desktop/Jenkins_Home:/var/jenkins_home -p 9191:8080 -p 40000:50000 jenkins\n\nReferences\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/\nhttps://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/\n\nNOTES\n\nBy default all files created inside a container are stored on a writable container layer\n\nThe data doesn’t persist when that container is no longer running\n\nA container’s writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running. You can’t easily move the data somewhere else.\n\nDocker has two options for containers to store files in the host machine\nso that the files are persisted even after the container stops\n\nVOLUMES  and  BIND MOUNTS\n\nVolumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker\n\nNon-Docker processes should not modify this part of the filesystem\n\nBind mounts may be stored anywhere on the host system\n\nNon-Docker processes on the Docker host or a Docker container can modify them at any time\n\nIn Bind Mounts, the file or directory is referenced by its full path on the host machine.\n\n\nVolumes are the best way to persist data in Docker\n\nvolumes are managed by Docker and are isolated from the core functionality of the host machine\n\nA given volume can be mounted into multiple containers simultaneously.\n\nWhen no running container is using a volume, the volume is still available to Docker and is not removed automatically. You can remove unused volumes using docker volume prune.\n\nWhen you mount a volume, it may be named or anonymous.\n\nAnonymous volumes are not given an explicit name when they are first mounted into a container\n\nVolumes also support the use of volume drivers, which allow you to store your data on remote hosts or cloud providers, among other possibilities.\n\n#DockerVolume #DockerBindMount #DockerContainers #DockerTutorials #DockerTraining #DevOpsTools #DevOpsTraining #DockerCommands #DockerForBeginners #DockerFreeTutorials #DockerforDevOps\n\nDOCKER PLAYLIST\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\nYOUTUBE PLAYLIST\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTt7...\n\nYOUTUBE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/automationste...\n\nFACEBOOK\nhttps://www.facebook.com/automationst...\n\nTWITTER\nhttps://twitter.com/automationsbs\n\nIf you like videos on the channel Automation Step by Step, hit the like button and share with others.\n\nClick the SUBSCRIBE button and hit the bell icon to keep getting new videos.\n\n________ ONLINE COURSES TO LEARN ________\n\nVisit - http://automationstepbystep.com/\n\n------------ Follow ------------\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/automationst...\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/automationsbs\nYoutube - http://youtube.com/automationstepbystep","viewCount":"98910","title":"What is Docker Volume | How to create  Volumes | What is Bind Mount | Docker Storage","lengthSeconds":"1010","videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/VOK06Q4QqvE/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1583011497222,"watchProgress":824.505549,"_id":"Tf6ywtOFqG9MLXlu"}

Inklusive Verspätungen und allem drum und dran. Und die werden wir in einem bunten Vortrag erforschen und endlich mal wieder ein bisschen Spaß mit Daten haben.\n\nRechtlicher Hinweis: Es liegt eine schriftliche Genehmigung der Bahn vor, von ihr abgerufene Rohdaten aggregieren und für Vorträge nutzen zu dürfen. Inhaltliche Absprachen oder gar Auflagen existieren nicht.\n\nDie Bahn gibt ihre Verspätungen in \"Prozent pünktlicher Züge pro Monat\" an. Das ist so radikal zusammengefasst, dass man daraus natürlich nichts interessantes lesen kann. Jetzt stellt euch mal vor, man könnte da mal ein bisschen genauer reingucken.\n\nStellt sich raus: Das geht! Davids Datensatz umfasst knapp 25 Millionen Halte - mehr als 50.000 pro Tag. Wir haben die Rohdaten und sind in unserer Betrachtung völlig frei.\n\nDer Vortrag hat wieder mehrere rote Fäden.\n\n1) Wir vermessen ein fast komplettes Fernverkehrsjahr der deutschen Bahn.   Hier etwas Erwartungsmanagement: Sinn ist keinesfalls Bahn-Bashing oder Sensationsheischerei - wer einen Hassvortrag gegen die Bahn erwartet, ist in dieser Veranstaltung falsch. Wir werden die Daten aber nutzen, um die Bahn einmal ein bisschen kennenzulernen. Die Bahn ist eine riesige Maschine mit Millionen beweglicher Teile. Wie viele Zugfahrten gibt es überhaupt? Was sind die größten Bahnhöfe? Wir werden natürlich auch die unerfreulichen Themen ansprechen, für die sich im Moment viele interessieren: Ist das Problem mit den Zugverspätungen wirklich so schlimm, wie alle sagen? Gibt es Orte und Zeiten, an denen es besonders hapert? Und wo fallen Züge einfach aus?\n\n2) Es gibt wieder mehrere Blicke über den Tellerrand, wie bei Davids vorherigen Vorträgen auch. Ihr werdet wieder ganz automatisch und nebenher einen allgemeinverständlichen Einblick in die heutige Datenauswerterei bekommen. (Eine verbreitete Verschwörungsheorie sagt, euch zur Auswertung öffentlicher Daten zu inspirieren, wäre sogar der Hauptzweck von Davids Vorträgen. :-) )Die Welt braucht Leute mit Ratio, die Analyse wichtiger als Kreischerei finden. Und darum beschreibt davod auch, wie man so ein durchaus aufwändiges Hobbyprojekt technisch angeht, Anfängerfehler vermeidet, und verantwortungsvoll handelt.\n\nDavid Kriesel\n\nhttps://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congre...","viewCount":"40144","title":"36C3 -  BahnMining - Pünktlichkeit ist eine Zier","lengthSeconds":"3710","videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/0rb9CfOvojk/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1577728226682,"watchProgress":3234.768686,"_id":"Upr42QIg3bgnYHmu"}

Her job consists solely of reading a script provided to her in real-time by an AI, leaving her no autonomy over what she says. Is Eliza a technological marvel that brings therapy to those who otherwise couldn’t access it? Or is it an ineffective replacement and another vector for technology companies to gain control\nover our lives and humanity?\n\nAs she reconnects with people from her past and gets to know the ordinary people of Seattle who use Eliza for counseling, Evelyn finds herself caught in the middle between differing sides of the argument— and as she begins to question everything\nabout her past life and future purpose in the world, it becomes clear she must confront the turmoil and darkness inside.\n\n#Eliza #NintendoSwitch\n\nSubscribe for more Nintendo fun! https://goo.gl/HYYsot\n\nVisit Nintendo.com for all the latest! http://www.nintendo.com/\n\nLike Nintendo on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/Nintendo\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/Nintendo\nFollow us on Pinterest: http://pinterest.com/Nintendo","viewCount":"134290","title":"Eliza - Announcement Trailer - Nintendo Switch","lengthSeconds":"79","videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/n53Z8LMg2wo/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1581101579014,"watchProgress":0,"_id":"VSM6b1V0aVXW4MkP"}

ALLIGATOAH zur Single „Wie Zuhause (MTV Unplugged - Single Edit)“.\n\nMit ihrer spektakulären MTV Unplugged Show haben sich SANTIANO am 11. & 12. Juni in der Lübecker Kulturwerft Gollan ein Denkmal gesetzt.\n\nDie Gästeliste der Show bestand dabei aus Hochkarätern der deutschen Musiklandschaft. Insbesondere die bereits im Vorfeld angekündigte und überwältigend homogene Konstellation mit Rapper und Produzent ALLIGATOAH auf „WIE ZUHAUSE“ repräsentiert die für MTV Unplugged typische Fusion unterschiedlichster musikalischer Welten und erscheint damit maßgeschneidert als erste Single zu „SANTIANO – MTV UNPLUGGED“.\n\nIhr großartiges Video, das aus intimen Backstage-Bildern in der MTV Unplugged-Kulisse und aus mitreißenden Performance-Szenen besteht, vermittelt, dass diese Version von „WIE ZUHAUSE“ die perfekte Zusammenführung zweier Genres ist, die homogener nicht hätten zusammenfinden können.\n\nEs ist die handgemachte Aufrichtigkeit, für die SANTIANO seit jeher stehen, und die sympathisch-unaufgeregte Lässigkeit mit der ALLIGATOAH zu Werke geht, die diese Künstler und Genres nahtlos miteinander verbindet. Und so steht dem wortgewaltigen 2018er Track des Rappers das Gewand aus Akustikgitarren, Fiddle und ansteckend geschmettertem Chorus schlicht hervorragend.\n\nBei dieser Version von SANTIANO FEAT. ALLIGATOAH kann sich der fröhlichen und ausgelassenen Stimmung wirklich niemand entziehen...\n\n++Alle Infos zur Single „Wie Zuhause (MTV Unplugged - Single Edit)“ hier++\nhttp://umgt.de/santiano\n\n++Folge Santiano im Netz++\n► Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SantianoMusik\n► Website: https://www.universal-music.de/santiano\n► Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/santianooff...\n► Twitter: https://twitter.com/santiano_org\n\n#Santiano #Alligatoah #MTVUnplugged #WieZuhause\n\nMusic video by Santiano performing Wie Zuhause (MTV Unplugged / Single Edit). © 2019 Santiano GbR, under exclusive license to Universal Music GmbH\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/n9f114","viewCount":"3239006","title":"","lengthSeconds":"203","videoThumbnails":"","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1581196862017,"watchProgress":0,"_id":"aMsqJSnkEXHzfcOY"}

{"videoId":"0bMSPf3H8h4","published":1489881600,"publishedText":"Mar 20th, 2017","description":"This video tutorial shows Arch Linux 2017 with LXDE Desktop and Review on VMware Workstation step by step. We'll also install applications such as Firefox, VLC, GIMP, Gedit and LibreOffice on Arch Linux 2017.03. This tutorial is also helpful to install Arch Linux 2017 on physical computer or server. We'll also install and test VMware Tools (Open VM Tools) on Arch Linux for better performance and usability features such as Fit Guest Now, Drag-Drop File, Clipboard Sharing and Mouse Integration.\n\nSteps:\n1- Download Arch Linux 2017.03 ISO\n2- Create Virtual Machine on VMware Workstation/Player\n3- Start Arch Linux Base Installation\n4- Installing Xorg and LXDE Desktop\n5- Installing Firefox, VLC, GIMP, Gedit and LibreOffice Applications on Arch Linux\n6- Install and Configure VMware Tools (Open VM Tools)\n7- Arch Linux 2017 LXDE Review\n\nWhat is Arch Linux?\nArch Linux is an independently developed, 86_64-optimized Linux distribution targeted at competent Linux users. It uses pacman, its home-grown package manager, to provide updates to the latest software applications with full dependency tracking. Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software. The installation images released by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main system components. The default install provides a solid base that enables users to create a custom installation. In addition, the Arch Build System (ABS) provides a way to easily build new packages, modify the configuration of stock packages, and share these packages with other users via the Arch Linux user repository. \nArch Linux Website: https://www.archlinux.org/\n\nArch Linux 2017.03 New Features and Improvements\nDue to the decreasing popularity of i686 among the developers and the community, they have decided to phase out the support of 32-bit architecture. Arch Linux 2017.02 ISO was the last that allows to install 32-bit Arch Linux. The next 9 months are deprecation period, during which i686 will be still receiving upgraded packages. Starting from November 2017, packaging and repository tools will no longer require that from maintainers, effectively making i686 unsupported. There's only one option for installing the Arch Linux operating system on new PCs, for 64-bit (x86_64) platforms.\n\nWhat is LXDE Desktop?\nLXDE, which stands for Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment, is a desktop environment which is lightweight and fast. It is designed to be user friendly and slim, while keeping the resource usage low. LXDE uses less RAM and less CPU while being a feature rich desktop environment. Unlike other tightly integrated desktops LXDE strives to be modular, so each component can be used independently with few dependencies. This makes porting LXDE to different distributions and platforms easier.\nLXDE Website: http://lxde.org/\n\nHope you found it informative and useful.

Unveiled this morning across UK radio, ‘Coming Home’ was the highlight of Cam and Joe’s recent Roundhouse show, when Rita joined them to perform the track live for the first time. The single is available to download from Friday 6th November, and as an iTunes ‘Instant Grat’ for fans who pre-order ‘Life’. ‘Coming Home’ sees Sigma once again collaborate with UK songwriting giants TMS and Wayne Hector (with whom they made ‘Changing’), and a stunning, acoustic version is available on the album.\n\nAcross ‘Life’s’ 20 tracks (on the deluxe edition), Cameron Edwards and Joe Lenzie have combined the UK’s hottest stars with the next wave of new British talent. Alongside Rita Ora, ‘Life’ features a dizzying array of collaborators including Ella Eyre, Ella Henderson, Diztortion, Maverick Sabre, Paloma Faith, Labrinth, Jacob Banks, Jetta, Bartoven, Majestic, Doctor, Nicole Jackson, and Ina Wroldsen.\n\nForged in the white-heat of drum & bass’s Noughties revival, Sigma have now sold over 2 million singles, with 4 hit records (2x OCC No.1s, 3 iTunes No.1s) and 2 platinum awards to date. They’ve received 2 Brits nominations, sold out their debut live tour, and played festival main stages across the world with performances including Glastonbury, Bestival, Reading & Leeds, V, T In The Park, Creamfields, SW4, EDC, Pukklepop, Sziget and beyond. They’re also the only drum & bass outfit to have performed at the BAFTAs ceremony one night, and a warehouse rave the next.\n\nSigma met at university while balancing raving and studying; two characters from different backgrounds (but with somewhat equally misspent youths) brought together by a shared love of hip hop and the unifying nature of Nineties post-rave dancefloors. Joe, who started learning the violin aged 3, swapped his strings, drums and keyboards for a pair of decks in his early teens, becoming a former DMC UK Champion scratch DJ when he was just 16. He started DJing at the nights that Cam – a jazz obsessive who’d become fascinated by jungle – was promoting in Leeds, they then began playing together, and later pooled their loans to buy production equipment to start creating their own music. As the band put it, their seemingly overnight success “has taken 10 years of sleepless nights”.\n\nThe last 18 months have been full of life-changing, pinch-yourself moments for both Cam and Joe, and ‘Life’ captures these ups (and downs). Alongside the hits ‘Nobody To Love’, ‘Changing’, ‘Higher’, and ‘Glitterball’, is recent single and live set opener, ‘Redemption’. The collaborations with Rita Ora (‘Coming Home’), Ella Eyre (‘Good Times’), and Maverick Sabre (‘Broken Promises’), are just some of ‘Life’s’ many standout tracks. Few debut albums contain so many hits before they’re released, but Sigma’s knack for turning soaring strings and heavy breakbeats into blow-your-speakers chart anthems shows why they’re set to dominate radio playlists and festival arenas for years to come.\n\nSigma have just completed their 10 date UK and Ireland live tour, which began with a sold out Warehouse Project show in Manchester, with further shows at London's Roundhouse, Newcastle, Dublin, Bristol, Sheffield, Portsmouth, Oxford, and Norwich.","viewCount":25509485,"title":"Sigma & Rita Ora - Coming Home (Official Music Video) HD","lengthSeconds":201,"videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/tS26xch5U24/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1570479351641,"watchProgress":0,"_id":"cYJT8A9nnAJfcML8"}

Heritage tourism makes up an important part of the city's economy, and with its colonial-era architecture, important archeological sites, delicious cuisine, and a beautiful art scene we can understand why so many people travel here. Yet beyond these great aspects, the reason that the #BDTeam traveled to Oaxaca City was to explore the culture around mezcal. \n\nOaxaca City is the capital of mezcal, and you could say that this drink is one of the world’s most complex and misunderstood liquors. Most people know that it’s made from the agave plant, just like Tequila, but did you know that Tequila is just one type of mezcal? Tequila is produced in only approved regions and only from a specific species of plant. In contrast to that, mezcal can be made from several other agave species which allows flavors to vary widely, from smoky and honeyed to grassy and peppery! The history of the drink is incredibly interesting and we hope this video encourages you to travel here someday and learn more.\n\nThe state of Oaxaca sponsors the International Mezcal Festival which is usually held every year here in Oaxaca City. During the festival, locals and tourists can sample and buy a large variety of mezcals.\n\nTEAM:\nArman Mitchell | Filmmaker & Editor https://www.instagram.com/armanmitchell/\nCory Martin | Filmmaker & Editor https://www.instagram.com/cory.s.martin/","viewCount":1712,"title":"The Oaxacan Chemist","lengthSeconds":147,"videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/zBtvesLJNqA/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1595178706096,"watchProgress":24.526797,"_id":"crmignPsdmGRQ3V0"}

Check out http://curiositystream.com/techlead for unlimited access to the world’s top documentaries and non­fiction series, and enter promo code ‘techlead’ for a free 30-day membership.\n\nIn this coding video, we create a \"Twitter clone\" using the classic LAMP web stack.  The demo and source code are here: http://tweetdemo.com/\n\nLAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP) has traditionally been a popular full-stack web-dev technique that powers many websites.  It's one of my favorite development techniques for quickly setting up a website.  I've purposely kept this tutorial as simple as possible to show you how you can also set up your own complete website as simply as possible.  From here, you can refactor code, bring in additional developer frameworks and libraries, scale out, and so forth, but this is a nice start to show you the foundations of web development.  BTW, I also recommend upgrading to the latest PHP7 if you continue working on this stack for the latest features.\n\nNote, that there are other popular techniques as well.  Some people may prefer using Docker containers instead of the monolithic server here for better scalability (though it's a more complex setup), or we could have used Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean for hosting instead of IBMCloud, and others might use entirely managed backends like Firebase or AWS Lambda.  Python with Flask/Django or NodeJS or Go could have been used instead of PHP/Apache as the web backend framework, and PostgreSQL or MongoDB could be swapped in for MySql as the database.  You could have also added a caching layer here using something like Memcached or Redis.  Given more time, we could have used a CDN as well for faster image loads, added a load-balancer, or used database replication for scalability.

Der Start soll 2021 mit einem niedrigen Einstiegspreis erfolgen, zitiert die Nachrichtenagentur dpa aus Koalitionskreisen. Die CO2-Bepreisung dürfte fossile Brennstoffe wie Benzin, Diesel, Heizöl und Erdgas verteuern. 2021 sollen Benzin und Diesel um 3 Cent teurer werden, bis 2026 dann zehn Cent. Die SPD favorisierte eine CO2-Steuer, die ist aber offenbar vom Tisch.  Im Gegenzug soll es Entlastungen geben. So soll die Pendlerpauschale ab 2021 um fünf Cent pro Kilometer angehoben werden. Pro Entfernungskilometer können demnach 35 statt 30 Cent von der Steuer abgesetzt werden. Und wer eine alte Ölheizung gegen ein klimafreundlichere Anlage auswechselt, soll danach mit bis zu 40 Prozent der Kosten gefördert werden. Der Einbau neuer Ölheizungen soll ab 2026 verboten sein.\n\nWie bereits diskutiert, soll Bahnfahren billiger werden, bestimmte Flüge sollen teurer werden. Der Ausbau des Ökostroms soll beschleunigt werden. Dazu gehört, dass beim Ausbau von Photovoltaik eine bisher geltende Förder-Begrenzung aufgehoben werden soll. Eine Million Ladesäuulen sollen Elektroautos attraktiver machen.\n\nWas das Ganze kosten soll, ist noch unklar. Von 30 bis 50 Milliarden Euro war immer wieder die Rede. Laut dpa will die Große Koalition aber nicht an der Schwarzen Null rütteln.","viewCount":23369,"title":"Maßnahmen zum Klimaschutz - Die Pressekonferenz zum Klimapaket der Großen Koalition.","lengthSeconds":4738,"videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/pqDVGpPMFOk/maxres.jpg","author":"tagesschau","authorId":"UC5NOEUbkLheQcaaRldYW5GA","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1569232565868,"watchProgress":null,"_id":"ej7gb5ZyqNwYTMtg"}

Jahrzehntelange Hitzewellen und Dürren haben zu massiven Ernteausfällen geführt, während die Ozeane sich erwärmen und die Menschen immer weniger Fisch fangen können. In den Tropen verhungern Millionen und der Krieg um Ressourcen zwingt weitere Millionen, Richtung Norden zu fliehen. Während sich die Lage weiter rasant verschlechtert, erlassen die Regierungen in einem Akt der Verzweiflung einen Notfallplan.\nEs ist bei weitem nicht sicher, dass ein so düsteres Szenario eintreten wird. Aber da die globale Führungsriege es bisher nicht geschafft hat, etwas gegen den Klimawandel zu tun, ist es auch nicht auszuschließen. In der nahen Zukunft könnte es also notwendig werden, etwas Radikales auszuprobieren, um den rasanten Klimawandel zu verlangsamen: Geo-Engineering. Eingriffe von so riesigem Ausmaß, dass sie Jahrhunderte menschlicher Zerstörung rückgängig machen könnten – oder aber sie machen alles noch viel schlimmer.

Pulling all the commens from accross my channel, and then finding my top 10.000 fans / top 10k commenters on my channel. Then I build a game where a bunch of cubes fight eacother, and finally load the comments into the players. Then all the players will get stats in the battle royale game, depending on how many comments they have on my channel. The game runs fine with 10,000 players, and could probably even do more.\nHope you enjoy this weird idea, I have some ideas for similar stuff as well, so make sure you slap subscribe.\nAlso thanks for the crazy response on my video \"He said I Couldn't Make a 3D Game...

Life Is Strange is a game set in the fictional seaside town of Arcadia Bay, located on the north west coast of America, in the state of Oregon.  \n\nLIS is a time travel and decision based story involving the residents of Arcadia Bay as well as the students and faculty members of Blackwell Academy, the private school located by the community. Taking centre stage are the characters Max Caulfield, Chloe Price, Rachel Amber, Kate Marsh, Warren Graham, Victoria Chase, Nathan Prescott and Mark Jefferson.\n\nLIS is an episodic game developed by DONTNOD, published by Square Enix and released in 5 parts through 2015 for Steam, PlayStation and Xbox. The game features an original soundtrack created by Jonathan Morali and LIS has inspired many songs by the talented YouTube musician KOETHE as well as fan art and fan fiction.\n\nLIS has sold 3 million copies as of May 2017 and has won numerous prestigious game industry awards.\n\nLIS has been followed up by a prequel game entitled Life Is Strange: Before the Storm. This game is also published by Square Enix, but was developed by a different studio, Deck Nine and will feature an original sound track created by the British indie folk band Daughter. LIS:BS will be released in 3 parts with the 1st episode released in August 2017.

Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.\n\nWhile this video uses COVID-19 (aka the Coronavirus) as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5I\n\nExtrapolation xkcd: https://xkcd.com/605/\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/a...\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjw...\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always great Terence Tao.\nhttps://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/...\n\nAlso, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle.  Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/a...\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjw...\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

Wir begleiten angehende Diplomaten.\nIm Frühjahr 2017 starteten Samira Cizero, Cristina Verones, Jonas Belina, Jean-Baptiste Délèze und Alexander Schärer ihre Ausbildung beim EDA, dem Eidgenössischen Departement für auswärtige Angelegenheiten. Sie besuchten seither verschiedenste Ausbildungskurse und absolvierten längere Praktika auf den Botschaften in Kairo, Buenos Aires, Dakar und Myanmar oder bei der UNO in New York, um sich so das Rüstzeug für die Diplomatie im Dienste der Schweiz zu erwerben. \n\nDie Serie erzählt von Politik und Diplomatie, aber auch von Ängsten und Hoffnungen der ganz unterschiedlichen Anwärterinnen und Anwärter. In den ersten Ausbildungskursen beim EDA geht es dann auch um die Grundlagen des diplomatischen Handwerks: Benimmregeln, Stylingfragen und erste praktische Aufgaben in Bern.\n\nDie Serie «Die jungen Diplomaten» gewährt einen Einblick hinter die Kulissen der Welt der Diplomatie. SRF begleitete die fünf Protagonisten des sogenannten «Concours diplomatique» während ihrer zweijährigen Ausbildung bis zur Diplomfeier.

I'll try uploading every week to keep you updated :)\n\nForgiveness : Escape Room was my first commercial game, It did really well on steam, played by great YouTubers, Twitch live streamers and of course the amazing fans.\nIt was really exciting to see big names like sodapoppin , sweet anita , xQcOW , Funhaus, Angory Tom and more - play my game.\nIt was a solo project that I worked on for almost a year, It's insane for me to think about all the work a game needs, code , music ,art ,sound effect , testing , redoing everything because you did it wrong, and so on.

But what if this technology is run by a morphed Mark Zuckerberg, who controls his company, a consultancy and the party all at once? And what happens if, like most start-ups and shady schemes, it all collapses? In the first instalment of DEMOCRAZY, Nico takes a look at Davide Casaleggio, the man steering the movement - perhaps into the ground.\"\n\n---------\n\nThank you for your support, Alexandra Geese, MEP!\n(https://twitter.com/alexandra_geese)\n\n---------\n\nSources / Picture credits:\n\n1) https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fi... | unknown | CC0 1.0\n\n2) https://flickr.com/photos/45198836@N0... | European People's Party | CC BY 2.0\n\n3) https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ma... | STEFANO CAVICCHI/REX\n\n4) Magazine \"Chi\" on the 25. 10. 2017\n\n5) https://vote.rousseau.movimento5stell... on 28/01/2020\n\n6) https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fi... | Niccolò Caranti | CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n----------\n\nResearch / further reading:\n\nOn Casaleggio:\nJason Horowitz, “The Mystery Man Who Runs Italy’s ‘Five Star’ From the Shadows,” The New York Times, 28 February 2018.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/wo....\n\nOn the Rousseau platform:\nJacopo Iacoboni, “The Experiment,” Jacobin, 3 Feb 2018 (accessed 15 Jan 2020),\nhttps://jacobinmag.com/2018/03/five-s....\n\nOn concerns about data collection and manipulation through Rousseau:\nGiovanni Navarria, The Networked Citizen: Power, Politics, and Resistance in the Internet Age, Giovanni Navarria, Palgrave Macmillan, 2019, pp. 205-210.\nhttps://books.google.be/books?id=5Ne5...\n\nOn Casaleggio’s dealings with Gilead:\nJacopo Iacoboni, “Sanità, report-Casaleggio pagato dall’azienda Gilead,” La Stampa, 2 January 2020.\nhttps://www.lastampa.it/topnews/primo....\n\nOn Casaleggio’s dealings with Philip Morris and Moby:\nCarlo Tecce, “Casaleggio, gioco, navi e tabacco: le lobby anti-M5s ingaggiano la società del fondatore,” Il Fatto Quotidiano, 17 October 2019.\nhttps://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/in-e...\n\n\n\n\nOn Casaleggio’s legal status in the party:\nLuciano Capone, “Esclusiva: così Davide Casaleggio è diventato il padrone del M5s,” Il Foglio, 31 January 2018.\nhttps://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2018....\n\nOn the connections between Rousseau, 5 Stars and Casaleggio Associates:\n“Di chi è l’Associaizone Rousseau?” Il Foglio, 19 February 2019.\nhttps://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2019....\n\nOn the 5-Star-Movement’s ideological “flexibility”:\nLuca Manucci and Michi Amsler, “Where the wind blows: Five Star Movement’s populism, direct democracy and ideological flexibility,” Italian Political Science Review, March 2018.\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/servic....\n\nOn the questionable purpose of party fees:\nLuciano Capone, “Il M5s nella scatoletta di Casaleggio,” Il Foglio, 4 January 2018.\nhttps://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2018....\n\n\n\n---------\n\nSubscribe to this channel:\nhttp://www.president2019.eu/?sub_conf...\n\nBuy Hoodies (in support of Hateaid):\nhttp://kannstedirschenken.de\n\nMost frequently asked questions:\nhttps://nicosemsrott.eu/en#faq-contact\n\n-----\nVideo Editing: Vanessa Göttle\n-----\nhttps://nicosemsrott.eu/\n-----\nSOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS\nhttp://www.president2019.eu/?sub_conf...\nhttp://www.instagram.com/nicosemsrott/\nhttp://www.twitter.com/nicosemsrott/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/nicosemsrott/\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONTACT\noffice@president2019.eu\nNico Semsrott /// Member of the European Parliament /// Rue Wiertz 60 /// 1047 Brussels /// Belgium","viewCount":"14999","title":"DEMOCRAZY: 5 Stars on Trickadvisor","lengthSeconds":"345","videoThumbnails":"https://invidio.us/vi/YuT22VzIXYA/maxres.jpg","liveNow":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","timeWatched":1580406343216,"watchProgress":234.225071,"_id":"zxS3Eu6grnZfgtJ5"}
